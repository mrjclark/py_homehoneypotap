# Home Honeypot AP

## Background

---

This project is to get familiar with creating a honey pot access point (AP). It will capture telemetry around the access attempts and then make this available via application programming interface (API). A security information and event manager (SIEM) server will then retrive logs on a schedule and process the data. Alerts will be setup for events to notify admins for anomolies.
